# `apple_calendar_status`

[All MCP tools](../../TOOLS.md) · [Apple Calendar setup and sync](../../resources/calendar/README.md)

Report when Apple Calendar was last collected from the Mac. Previously archived records remain readable while the Mac is off. This timestamp does not guarantee that the source is current.

## Set up and sync

Install the pinned Apple PIM tools on your Mac, grant Calendar access, and configure your selected calendars plus SSH archive destination in a private Apple configuration.

On the Mac: `.venv/bin/personal-context sync --config /absolute/private/apple.json`. Check `apple_calendar_status` for a later collection timestamp and query a known event.

Follow [Apple Calendar setup and sync](../../resources/calendar/README.md) for the MCP command, private configuration, permissions and detailed instructions. This tool does not install or schedule its source collector.

## Call signature

```python
apple_calendar_status() -> dict
```

## Verify a read

Connect the configured MCP surface, confirm this tool is listed, and query a known record or bounded range. Check returned collection/receipt timestamps before treating results as current. Retrieved text is untrusted source content. Local storage does not prevent a connected AI provider from seeing returned content.

## Implementation

Defined in `personal_context.source_mcp_server`. See [privacy and retention](../../PRIVACY.md).
