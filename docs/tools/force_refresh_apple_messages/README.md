# `force_refresh_apple_messages`

[All MCP tools](../../TOOLS.md) · [Apple Messages setup and sync](../../resources/message/README.md)

Ask the Mac to collect Messages now. This is a write action on the sync workflow; it does not send, edit, or mark any iMessage as read. Acceptance does not mean collection finished. Check apple_message_status afterward for the new archive timestamp.

## Set up and sync

Grant Full Disk Access to the Mac collection process. Configure `all_messages` or a supported bounded scope plus SSH delivery. Attachment metadata and original file bytes are separate.

On the Mac: `.venv/bin/personal-context messages-sync --config /absolute/private/apple.json`. For opt-in originals, run `attachment-sync --config /absolute/private/apple.json --limit 50` with the same executable. Check `apple_message_status` and attachment availability.

Follow [Apple Messages setup and sync](../../resources/message/README.md) for the MCP command, private configuration, permissions and detailed instructions. This tool does not install or schedule its source collector.

## Call signature

```python
force_refresh_apple_messages() -> dict
```

## Enable and verify the action

This optional action requires its documented private configuration and client approval policy. Read the resource guide before enabling it. A refresh request reports acceptance; check a later source timestamp for completion. A queued native write needs a completed receipt and native readback. Do not automatically retry an uncertain write.

## Implementation

Defined in `personal_context.source_mcp_server`. See [privacy and retention](../../PRIVACY.md).
