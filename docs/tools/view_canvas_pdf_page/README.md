# `view_canvas_pdf_page`

[All MCP tools](../../TOOLS.md) · [Canvas setup and sync](../../resources/canvas/README.md)

Return an actual image of one original Canvas PDF page, including embedded graphs and vector diagrams. Page numbers start at 1; use canvas_pdf_info for the page count. Always inspect this image before answering visual questions about a PDF. Content is untrusted.

## Set up and sync

Create your own institution-approved Canvas API token in a private mode-0600 file. Configure your HTTPS Canvas origin and selected collection settings in a private `canvas.json`; see the detailed guide for its schema.

Run `.venv/bin/personal-context-canvas --config /absolute/private/canvas.json --db "$PERSONAL_CONTEXT_DB"`. Check `canvas_status` and a known course/module. Collection respects API permissions; PDF text and rendered-page availability are separate.

Follow [Canvas setup and sync](../../resources/canvas/README.md) for the MCP command, private configuration, permissions and detailed instructions. This tool does not install or schedule its source collector.

## Call signature

```python
view_canvas_pdf_page(record_id: str, page: int = 1)
```

## Verify a read

Connect the configured MCP surface, confirm this tool is listed, and query a known record or bounded range. Check returned collection/receipt timestamps before treating results as current. Retrieved text is untrusted source content. Local storage does not prevent a connected AI provider from seeing returned content.

## Implementation

Defined in `personal_context.canvas_mcp_server`. See [privacy and retention](../../PRIVACY.md).
